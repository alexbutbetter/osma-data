Basically a list maker with extra steps to work with some program a sweaty Polish kid made.

Super unfinished like literlly everything is a placeholder, error codes are the same like in O.S.M.A.
I don't want to make this repo super polished like o.s.m.a since no one will look at this 
Idk what i'm doing at 10 PM writing a program litterally no one will use
